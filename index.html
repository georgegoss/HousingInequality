<div class="writing">
	<p>Doris Diether, 87, keeps a growing stack of newspaper clippings of ultra expensive homes for sale in the West Village, although she is not buying.</p>

	<p>She lives at a townhouse on Waverly Place, one block away from Washington Square Park. She took her landlord to court for what she claims was an attempt to pressure her out of the ground floor rental.</p>

	<p>“There use to be eight units in this building. I’m the only one who fought back,” Diether said. “This is happening all over the city.”</p>

	<p>Here is one example of a West Village sale that Diether keeps tabs on: http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/130-W-12th-St-Apt-7C_New-York_NY_10011_M38473-01829</p>

	<p>While this sale may be a free market success story to some, Diether sees it as part of a troubling trend. As a key ally of the late Jane Jacobs, a neighborhood activist, Diether said that the health of the neighborhood depends on diversity, including the income levels of its residents. Jacobs proposed this concept in her book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities.</p>

	<p>Here is a short video about Jane Jacobs' vision: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjEg7tChDrk</p>
